#   'sigma.txt' is the replacement for 'weights.txt',  and renders it
# obsolete.  It is similar to 'weights.txt',  but extends its capabilities.
#
#   'sigma.txt' allows you to set up rules describing the default
# uncertainties in position,  time,  and magnitude for astrometric data.
# The idea is that you can tell Find_Orb that all observations from a
# given observatory over a given time span and magnitude range have,
# by your estimate,  specific uncertainties in those three quantities.
#
#   The resulting uncertainties are simply default values,  used when
# there's no other way to know the uncertainty.  If you use the
# AstDyS/NEODyS .rwo format,  the data have astrometric uncertainties
# given with each observation.  And Find_Orb provides ways to specify
# uncertainties via special keywords within the observations.  See
#
# https://www.projectpluto.com/find_orb.htm#sigmas
#
#  for details.
#
#   This is a revised version of what used to be 'weight.txt'.  That
# file was quite similar,  except that instead of storing uncertainties,
# weights were stored.  These basically just boiled down to 1/sigma_posn,
# with sigma_posn expressed in arcseconds.  Also,  only sigmas for
# position could be defined;  'sigma.txt' adds sigmas for magnitude
# and time as well;  and allows you to specify a project code as well.
#
#   Find_Orb looks through this file from top to bottom.  Non-comment
# lines give an observatory code,  an optional program code,  and a date
# range and magnitude range.  (The ranges can be blank,  to specify "any
# date" and/or "any magnitude",  or to indicate that there is no lower
# or upper limit on that range.)  The idea is that such a line defines
# what the sigmas are for any observation from that code,  taken within
# that date range,  and within that magnitude range.
#
#   When Find_Orb finds a line describing the observation in question,
# it extracts any non-blank sigmas.  It keeps going,  possibly to
# the bottom of the file,  until sigmas have been found for all
# three quantities. That's why there is a final line that will
# assign sigmas to _any_ observation that hasn't already been handled.
#
#    Comments can be added at the end of each line.  I've just listed
# the station names in that slot.
#
#   Some comments on how to assign sigmas are at the bottom of this text.
# I've noticed that the following stations get unusually good astrometry.
# These uncertainties roughly reflect how well I've seen them do :

# The radar folks don't really have 'uncertainties' in RA/dec or mag;

#  You MUST have some final "catchall" lines that assign sigmas to all

# line mentioned above,  to assign uncertainties to anything not already
# found.  It's also used if you have turned off weighting (i.e.,  all
# observations are to be treated equally,  with identical uncertainties).

# HOW TO ASSIGN SIGMAS:  I don't really know of a simple way to do this.
# The above numbers reflect what I've observed in the data,  and are
# better than no sigmas at all,  but they are somewhat ad hoc.
#
#   One _can_ analyze data from an individual observatory and get a feel
# for what their RMS residuals are and base the sigmas on that.  It helps
# if the observatory in question gets a _lot_ of data,  to get some
# meaningful statistics.  .rwo files give uncertainties assigned in
# this manner.
